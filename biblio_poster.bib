  abstract = {Satellite ocean tracer images, of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and
        Ocean Colour images, for example, show patterns like fronts and filaments
        that characterise the flow dynamics. These patterns can be described
        using Lagrangian tools such as Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE)
        or Finite-Time Lyapunov Vectors (FTLV). In recent years, several
        studies have investigated the possibility of directly assimilating
        structured data from satellite images into numerical models. In this
        paper, we exploit specific properties of FTLE and FTLV to define
        observation operators that can beused in a direct ocean tracer image
        assimilation scheme. In an idealised context, weshow that high-resolution
        SST and Ocean Colour images can be exploited to correct velocity
        fields using FTLE or FTLV.},

  abstract = {We characterize horizontal mixing and transport structures in the
        surface circulation of the Mediterranean Sea, as obtained from a
        primitive equation circulation model. We calculate the Finite Size
        Lyapunov Exponents (FSLEs) of the velocity data set, which give a
        direct measure of the local stirring. By proper election of the FSLE
        parameters, we focus on the mesoscale structures, locating a number
        of vortices embedded in an intricate network of high-stretching lines.
        These lines control transport in the system. At the edge of the vortices,
        a dense tangle of line intersections appears, identifying strong
        mixing. The spatial distribution of FSLEs, averaged over one year,
        allows to classify areas in the Mediterranean basin according by
        their mixing activity. The space average of FSLEs on selected geographical
        regions gives a measure for quantifying and comparing the mixing
        seasonal variability.},

  abstract = {The effect of the geostrophic stirring on phytoplankton variability
        during the northeast Atlantic spring bloom is studied by analyzing
        satellite derived surface chlorophyll, sea surface temperature, and
        sea surface height. The calculation of unstable manifolds is used
        as a diagnostic of the transport properties of the geostrophic velocity
        field (calculated from the sea surface height). We identify two mechanisms
        by which the geostrophic velocity field acts on chlorophyll patterns.
        The first mechanism is a direct effect of the horizontal transport
        on already formed chlorophyll. By acting as 'sticking' transport
        barriers, the unstable manifolds are shown to (1) modulate the fronts
        of already formed phytoplankton in lobular structures, (2) create
        spiralling chlorophyll anomalies within eddies, and (3) produce chlorophyll
        filaments. The second mechanism is an indirect effect on in situ
        chlorophyll production mediated by nutrient upwelling. Supported
        by a recent study on the vertical velocities of the northeast Atlantic
        (Legal et al., 2006), we argue that the horizontal unstable manifolds
        also shape the filamentary, vertical velocity cells, and hence the
        patterns of in situ produced chlorophyll through submesoscale vertical
        nutrient injection.},
